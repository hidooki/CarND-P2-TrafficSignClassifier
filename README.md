## CarND-P2-TrafficSignClassifier

This is the second project in the Udacity [Self Driving Car Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) "nanodegree" program. It consists in training a neural network to classify pictures of traffic signs. A detailed description of the steps is included in the [writeup](https://github.com/hidooki/CarND-P2-TrafficSignClassifier/blob/master/writeup.md), while the code is contained in the Jupyter [Notebook](https://github.com/hidooki/CarND-P2-TrafficSignClassifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb).
